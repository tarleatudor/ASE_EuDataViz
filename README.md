# Multimedia Web Project – Interactive Graphics Application

## Project Overview

This project is a client-side multimedia web application developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, as part of the Multimedia Systems course. The application focuses on interactive graphics, user-driven events, and dynamic rendering, following strict academic constraints with no external JavaScript libraries.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of web-based multimedia technologies, including canvas and SVG graphics, event handling, and dynamic user interaction.
